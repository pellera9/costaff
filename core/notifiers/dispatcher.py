"""Cross-channel notification dispatcher.

Resolves an opaque recipient (which may be a hashed_id or a session_id)
through the IdentityMap, picks the right notifier (telegram / discord /
line) based on the requested channel, and forwards the message.

Used by the MCP scheduler executors and any other place that needs to
push a system-generated message to a user without going through the
agent loop.
