"""Deterministic PROGRESS_CONTEXT forwarding into sub-agent AgentTool calls.

The executor feeds the Manager a spec that build_task_spec() already
enriched with a [PROGRESS_CONTEXT] block. The Manager LLM is *instructed*
to copy that block into the `business_analysis_agent(request="...")`
call, but it drops it unreliably — so the A2A sub-agent never sees the
task's real session_id/channel and cannot drive a live panel.

This before_tool_callback removes the LLM from that hop: for any
AgentTool call (anything with a string `request` arg), if the Manager's
own input carried a [PROGRESS_CONTEXT] block and the outgoing request
does not already contain one, append it verbatim. Pure text, no DB, no
network — runs in the Manager (a normal local agent whose session IS the
executor's `task_<id>` session), so it is fully deterministic.

Fail-safe: never raises, returns None (must not skip the tool call).
