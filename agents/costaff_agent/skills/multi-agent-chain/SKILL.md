# Multi-Agent Orchestration SOP

## When to Use
- A task requires delegating to one or more registered specialist agent tools (`<agent_name>(request: str)`)
- Two or more specialists need to work in sequence (output of one → input of next)
- User asks to combine multiple specialist capabilities in a single workflow

---

## Principle 1 — Present a Plan First (multi-step only)

When a request requires **two or more** specialist calls (any file or data hand-off between specialists), present a written plan and wait for user confirmation **before calling any agent tool**.

**Skip the plan (proceed immediately) when**:
- A single specialist fulfils the whole request
- User already confirmed a plan earlier in this session
- User says "直接做", "不用計劃", "go ahead", or similar

**Plan format (Telegram HTML — use exactly):**
```
📋 <b>執行計劃</b>

<b>Step 1: [專家職稱] (agent: <code>&lt;agent_name&gt;</code>)</b>
• 任務：...
• 輸入：...
• 預期產出：<code>/app/data/shared/costaff-agent-&lt;hyphen-name&gt;/xxx.ext</code>

<b>Step 2: [專家職稱] (agent: <code>&lt;agent_name&gt;</code>)</b>
• 任務：...
• 輸入：Step 1 的產出
• 預期產出：<code>...</code>

請回覆「OK」開始執行，或告訴我需要調整的地方（工具、順序、輸出格式等）。
```

After presenting the plan: **STOP**. Do not call any tool. Wait for the user's next message.
- Confirmation ("OK", "好", "同意", "開始", "go") → proceed to execute
- Change request → update plan, present again for re-confirmation
- Clarifying question → answer it, then re-confirm the (possibly revised) plan

---

## Principle 1A — Iteration: Use the Existing Path (apply BEFORE drafting the Plan)

Classify the request before planning. **An iteration is anything that touches a deliverable that already exists in this session.**

**Iteration signals** (any of these → treat as iteration):
- The request refers to a previously delivered file or feature
- The request uses modify / fix / extend verbs. Examples (Chinese): 改, 修, 加, 優化, 升級, 修復, 沒了, 不見了, 不能用. Examples (English): fix, update, extend, broken, bug, missing, not working
- The request reports a defect in something already shipped this session
- The request adds a feature to a deliverable already produced

**When the request is iteration — strict rules**:

1. **Reuse the existing path.** The plan's expected-output path MUST be the **same path** as the previous deliverable.
   **FORBIDDEN suffixes** on the filename: `_v2`, `_v3`, `_new`, `_fixed`, `_updated`, `-mobile`, `-deluxe`, `-final`, or any version marker. The file is updated in place — git is for tracking history, not filenames.

2. **Plan wording**: describe the action as "modify the existing file at `<path>`" (in the user's preferred language), not "create a new file".

3. **The `request` you pass to a coding-style specialist MUST contain this exact instruction block** (in addition to describing the change):
   ```
   This is an in-place modification of an existing file at <absolute path>.
   Use patch_file() or insert_after_line() for surgical edits.
   Do NOT call write_file() to overwrite the whole file.
   Do NOT create a new versioned filename (no _v2, _new, _fixed suffixes).
   ```

4. **Keep all related files under the same project subdirectory.** Do not spawn a new project dir per iteration.

**When the request is a brand-new build** (no prior deliverable in this session, no existing file referenced): proceed normally — choose a fresh project directory and filename.

---

## Principle 2 — Write a Complete `request` (CRITICAL)

The specialist agent tool receives **only the `request` string you write** — it does not see the user's prior messages, your plan text, or the conversation history. If `request` is vague, ambiguous, or just an acknowledgement like "OK" or "go", the specialist has no context and will reply conversationally without doing any work.

**Every `request` must be self-contained and imperative.** Include:

| Element | Required? | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Concrete action verb | always | "Load the wine dataset and run EDA…" |
| Input source / file paths | if any | "Read `/app/data/shared/costaff-agent-coding/wine_results.json`" |
| Expected output format & path | always | "Save as `/app/data/shared/costaff-agent-business-analysis/wine_report.pdf`" |
| Constraints / language / quality bar | as needed | "Report in Traditional Chinese; include charts and analysis narrative" |
| `[PROGRESS_CONTEXT]` block (when applicable) | if user-facing progress matters | with `user_id`, `channel`, `session_id` |

**Forbidden in `request`:**
- ❌ Mentions of other specialists or chaining ("then pass to X", "after this, transfer to Y")
- ❌ Orchestration verbs aimed at the specialist ("delegate", "transfer", "hand off")
- ❌ Empty / single-word strings ("OK", "go", "do it") — the specialist will not act
- ❌ References to "the user's earlier message" or "what was discussed" — the specialist cannot see those

The specialist's only job: **do the work, save the file, report back**. Chaining to the next specialist is your responsibility after the current call returns.

---

## Principle 3 — Execute One Specialist at a Time, In Order

Call only one agent tool per step. **Wait for the tool to return** before calling the next. The return value is the specialist's completion signal — do not begin the next step until you have it.

A valid completion signal always includes at least one of:
- An absolute output file path (e.g. `/app/data/shared/costaff-agent-<name>/result.csv`)
- A concrete computed result or value
- A structured analysis, summary, or conclusion
- An explicit failure declaration explaining why the task cannot be completed

Mid-task progress messages sent via `send_message_now` (e.g. "安裝中…", "🔍 開始調查") are **NOT** completion signals — the specialist may emit several before its tool call finally returns.

---

## Principle 4 — Pass Exact Results, Never Reconstruct

Extract the **exact** output from the specialist's return value (file path, value, identifier) and pass it verbatim into the next specialist's `request`. Never retype, reconstruct, or guess.

**Path naming (CRITICAL — common bug source)**:
- Filesystem paths use **hyphens**: `costaff-agent-business-analysis`
- Agent tool names use **underscores**: `business_analysis(request=...)`
- Never derive one from the other; refer to each registered tool's exact name

---

## Principle 5 — Brief Progress Updates Are Allowed Between Calls

Between two specialist calls, you may emit a brief `send_message_now` progress line so the user knows work is continuing. Keep it to one Chinese sentence (e.g. "▶️ 商業分析專家正在生成報告，請稍候。"). Do NOT include internal reasoning, file paths, or technical details in these progress lines.

After **all** specialists have returned completion signals, compose and emit your final consolidated text response to the user.

---

## Principle 6 — Deliver a Single Final Reply

After all specialists have returned, send one consolidated response containing:
- A 1–2 sentence summary of which specialists collaborated (no jargon)
- **All output file paths** in `[FILE: /absolute/path]` format — include intermediate files (CSV/JSON), not just the final PDF
- Any key insights or findings from the results

**In partial success**: if the chain fails mid-way, still deliver every artifact produced by successful steps. Never omit intermediate files.

**Verify before reporting**: Before saying "報告已生成" or "已傳遞給X", confirm you have an actual completion signal (file path or concrete result) from that specialist. If you have only progress signals or the tool call has not yet returned, do not claim completion. When in doubt, call `list_data_files` to verify the file exists on disk.

---

## Principle 7 — Forbidden: Specialist's Internal Tools

A specialist's internal MCP tools are **NOT** in your toolset. Calling them raises `ValueError: Tool '<name>' not found` and crashes the run. You may see those tool names listed inside a specialist's agent card — that is purely informational about what the specialist itself can do internally.

**Common forbidden tools by typical specialist role (illustrative — confirm against each specialist's actual description):**

| Likely role | Internal tools you must NOT call |
|---|---|
| Coding / Python execution | `run_python_code`, `write_file`, `patch_file`, `lint_file`, `run_shell`, `pip_install`, `run_pytest` |
| Reporting / visualisation | `export_pdf`, `export_pptx`, `create_html_report`, `create_report_from_markdown`, `generate_chart` |
| Database access | `run_query`, `get_schema`, `list_tables`, `execute_sql` |

**Your own legitimate tools are**: the registered specialist agent tools (one per agent), `send_message_now`, `get_user_profile`, `update_user_profile`, `get_current_time`, `check_identity`, reminder tools, regular-work tools, epic/story/task tools, diary tools, API/skill index tools, `move_to_shared`, `list_data_files`.

If a function name you are about to call is not in the list above and is not a registered specialist tool — stop. You are about to call a specialist's internal tool.

### Recovery: "Tool Not Found" Error

If you receive `ValueError: Tool '<name>' not found`:

1. **DO NOT retry** the same forbidden tool call
2. **DO NOT fabricate** any result, file path, or completion message to the user
3. Identify which specialist owns the tool (see table above)
4. Call that specialist via its agent tool (`<agent_name>(request='...')`) and wait for its completion signal
5. Only after receiving the real return value → report to the user

If the specialist also fails after one retry → report partial results honestly and stop.

---

## Principle 8 — Retry Limits

- Each specialist may be retried **at most once** on failure
- If the same specialist fails **twice consecutively** → stop immediately
- Do NOT attempt workarounds (different paths, alternative directories)
- Report failure honestly: what succeeded, what failed, what partial artifacts were produced
- Each distinct specialist tool call counts as one attempt

---

## Output Presentation

1. Extract only content wrapped in `[RESULT_START]` / `[RESULT_END]` tags from specialist return values. If no tags found, use the last meaningful paragraph only.
2. Filter out: `_Thinking:_` prefixes, raw JSON, tool call logs, code blocks, English reasoning.
3. **Convert Markdown to Telegram HTML** — specialists write in Markdown; you MUST convert before sending:
   - `**text**` → `<b>text</b>`
   - `*text*` or `_text_` → `<i>text</i>`
   - `` `text` `` → `<code>text</code>`
   - `# Heading` / `## Heading` → `<b>Heading</b>` (no heading tags in Telegram)
   - `- item` → `• item` (keep the bullet, remove the dash)
4. Deliver ALL files using `[FILE: /app/data/shared/costaff-agent-<name>/file.ext]` format — include intermediate files (CSV, PNG) AND final output (PDF).
5. Use `{PREFERRED_LANGUAGE}` and Telegram HTML throughout.
6. Never output raw JSON, `_Thinking:_`, English reasoning, or Markdown syntax to the user.

## Common Mistakes Summary

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Writing a vague `request` like "OK" or "do it" | Specialist replies conversationally without acting |
| Mentioning other specialists or chaining inside `request` | Specialist may try to delegate and fail / get confused |
| Calling a specialist's internal MCP tool directly | `ValueError` → run crashes |
| Treating a `send_message_now` progress line as the completion signal | Next specialist receives incomplete or fabricated input |
| Reconstructing or guessing an output path | Wrong path → downstream specialist fails |
| Fabricating a result after a tool error | Critical hallucination — user receives false information |
| Using hyphens in agent tool name / underscores in file path | Path or specialist not found |
