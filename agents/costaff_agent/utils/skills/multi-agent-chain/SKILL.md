# Multi-Agent Orchestration SOP

## When to Use
- A task requires delegating to one or more sub-agents via `transfer_to_agent`
- Two or more agents need to work in sequence (output of one → input of next)
- User asks to combine multiple specialist capabilities in a single workflow

---

## Principle 1 — Present a Plan First (multi-step only)

When a request requires **two or more** sub-agent calls (any file or data hand-off between agents), present a written plan and wait for user confirmation **before calling any agent tool**.

**Skip the plan (proceed immediately) when**:
- A single sub-agent fulfils the whole request
- User already confirmed a plan earlier in this session
- User says "直接做", "不用計劃", "go ahead", or similar

**Plan format (Telegram HTML — use exactly):**
```
📋 <b>執行計劃</b>

<b>Step 1: [專家職稱] (agent: <code>&lt;a2a_name&gt;</code>)</b>
• 任務：...
• 輸入：...
• 預期產出：<code>/app/data/shared/costaff-agent-&lt;hyphen-name&gt;/xxx.ext</code>

<b>Step 2: [專家職稱] (agent: <code>&lt;a2a_name&gt;</code>)</b>
• 任務：...
• 輸入：Step 1 的產出
• 預期產出：<code>...</code>

請回覆「OK」開始執行，或告訴我需要調整的地方（工具、順序、輸出格式等）。
```

After presenting the plan: **STOP**. Do not call any tool. Wait for the user's next message.
- Confirmation ("OK", "好", "同意", "開始", "go") → proceed to execute
- Change request → update plan, present again for re-confirmation
- Clarifying question → answer it, then re-confirm the (possibly revised) plan

---

## Principle 2 — Execute One Agent at a Time, In Order

Call only one agent per step via `transfer_to_agent`. **Wait for the A2A call to fully resolve** before proceeding to the next.

Each agent emits two types of events — you MUST distinguish them:

| Event type | Characteristics | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Progress signal** (mid-task) | Status messages sent via `send_message_now` — "安裝中…", "正在執行…", "🔍 開始調查" | Keep waiting — the agent is still running |
| **Completion signal** (final A2A response) | Contains a file path, computed result, structured summary, or explicit failure message | Proceed to next step |

A valid completion signal always includes at least one of:
- An absolute output file path (e.g. `/app/data/shared/costaff-agent-coding/result.csv`)
- A concrete computed result or value
- A structured analysis, summary, or conclusion
- An explicit failure declaration explaining why the task cannot be completed

If you only have progress signals, the task is **still in progress**. While in this state, you are **strictly forbidden** from fabricating results, calling the next agent, or telling the user the task is done.

---

## Principle 3 — Pass Exact Results, Never Reconstruct

Extract the **exact** output from the completion signal (file path, value, identifier) and pass it verbatim to the next agent. Never retype, reconstruct, or guess.

**Path naming (CRITICAL — common bug source)**:
- Filesystem paths use **hyphens**: `costaff-agent-business-analysis`
- `transfer_to_agent(agent_name=...)` uses **underscores**: `business_analysis`
- Never derive one from the other

---

## Principle 4 — No Plain Text Between Agent Calls

Emitting a plain-text response in a multi-step chain **immediately terminates the current ADK run**. Subsequent `transfer_to_agent` calls will never execute.

- **Between steps**: use `send_message_now(body="...")` for progress updates — this is a tool call, not a text response
- **Only after ALL agents complete**: compose and emit your final text response to the user

---

## Principle 5 — Deliver a Single Final Reply

After all agents have returned completion signals, send one consolidated response containing:
- A 1–2 sentence summary of which specialists collaborated (no jargon)
- **All output file paths** in `[FILE: /absolute/path]` format — including intermediate files (CSV/JSON), not just the final PDF
- Any key insights or findings from the results

**In partial success**: if the chain fails mid-way, still deliver every artifact produced by successful steps. Never omit intermediate files.

---

## Principle 6 — Check Roster Before Each Agent Call

Before each `transfer_to_agent` call, verify the target agent appears in the **Team Roster** (Section 6.2 of the main instruction).
- If the agent is in the roster → proceed
- If the agent is NOT in the roster → inform the user it is not deployed and stop the chain at that step

---

## Principle 7 — Forbidden: Sub-Agent Internal Tools

Sub-agent MCP tools are **NOT** available in your toolset. Calling them raises `ValueError: Tool '<name>' not found` and crashes the run. You may see these tools listed in a sub-agent's agent card — that is purely informational.

**Common forbidden tools by agent:**

| Tool | Belongs to |
|---|---|
| `export_pdf`, `export_pptx`, `create_html_report`, `create_report_from_markdown`, `generate_chart`, `read_csv`, `analyze_data` | business_analysis |
| `run_python_code`, `write_file`, `patch_file`, `lint_file`, `run_shell`, `pip_install`, `run_pytest` | coding |
| `run_query`, `get_schema`, `list_tables`, `execute_sql` | database |

**Your legitimate tools**: `transfer_to_agent`, `send_message_now`, `get_user_profile`, `update_user_profile`, `get_current_time`, `check_identity`, reminder tools, regular-work tools, epic/story/task tools, diary tools, API/skill index tools, `move_to_shared`.

If a function name you are about to call is not in this list and is not obviously one of the above — stop. You are about to call a sub-agent's internal tool.

### Recovery: "Tool Not Found" Error

If you receive `ValueError: Tool '<name>' not found`:

1. **DO NOT retry** the same forbidden tool call
2. **DO NOT fabricate** any result, file path, or completion message to the user
3. Identify which agent owns the tool (see table above)
4. Call `transfer_to_agent(agent_name='<correct_agent>', message='...')` and wait for its genuine completion signal
5. Only after receiving the real response → report to user

If the sub-agent also fails after one retry → report partial results honestly and stop.

---

## Principle 8 — Retry Limits

- Each sub-agent may be retried **at most once** on failure
- If the same sub-agent fails **twice consecutively** → stop immediately
- Do NOT attempt workarounds (different paths, alternative directories)
- Report failure honestly: what succeeded, what failed, what partial artifacts were produced
- Each distinct `transfer_to_agent` call to the same agent counts as one attempt

---

## Output Presentation

1. Extract only content wrapped in `[RESULT_START]` / `[RESULT_END]` tags from sub-agent responses
2. Filter out: `_Thinking:_` prefixes, raw JSON, tool call logs, code blocks
3. Deliver ALL files using `[FILE: /app/data/shared/costaff-agent-<name>/file.ext]` format
4. Use `{PREFERRED_LANGUAGE}` and Telegram HTML (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<code>`)
5. Never output raw JSON, `_Thinking:_`, or tool call logs to the user

## Common Mistakes Summary

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Calling a sub-agent's internal MCP tool directly | `ValueError` → run crashes |
| Emitting plain text between two `transfer_to_agent` calls | ADK run terminates — next agent never executes |
| Treating a progress signal as a completion signal | Next agent receives incomplete input |
| Reconstructing or guessing an output path | Wrong path → downstream agent fails |
| Fabricating a result after a tool error | Critical hallucination — user receives false information |
| Skipping roster check | Agent not deployed, call fails with no meaningful error |
| Using hyphens in `agent_name` / underscores in file path | Path or agent not found |
